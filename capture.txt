''' Building a Microsoft Edge browser extension with the described features involves several steps, 
including setting up the project, implementing the necessary functionality for capturing webpages, managing settings, 
and integrating with OneNote or other destinations. Here’s a structured approach to help you get started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
  
   - Set up a development environment with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
   - Optionally, install a code editor like Visual Studio Code for easier development.

2. **Extension Development Tools**:
   - Use Microsoft Edge Developer Tools for debugging and testing your extension.
   - Install necessary browser APIs or polyfills for compatibility.

### Steps to Build the Extension

#### 1. Initialize the Project

1. **Create a New Extension Project**:
   - Use the Microsoft Edge Extension Manifest template to scaffold your project.
   - Alternatively, start with a basic directory structure containing manifest files (`manifest.json`).

2. **Setup Manifest.json**:
   - Define the basic information about your extension, including name, description, version, permissions (`tabs`, `activeTab` for capturing), and icons.

#### 2. User Interface (UI) Development

1. **Popup or Sidebar UI**:
   - Create an HTML file (`popup.html`) for the extension’s user interface.
   - Design a simple interface using HTML and CSS for selecting capture options (format, size), setting destinations, and configuring settings.

2. **Event Handling with JavaScript**:
   - Use JavaScript (`popup.js`) to handle user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
   - Implement logic to save user preferences using browser storage APIs (`chrome.storage` or `browser.storage`).

#### 3. Capture Webpages

1. **Capture Logic**:
   - Implement capturing of webpages using browser APIs (`chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` for Chrome-compatible browsers or `browser.tabs.captureVisibleTab` for Firefox and Edge).
   - Allow users to specify full page capture or a custom size (viewport size).

2. **Format Conversion**:
   - Convert captured content to different formats (JPEG, text, PDF) based on user selection.
   - Utilize libraries or APIs (like html2canvas, pdfkit) for generating PDFs or text from HTML content.

#### 4. Settings Management

1. **Options Page**:
   - Develop an HTML (`options.html`) and JavaScript (`options.js`) page for managing extension settings.
   - Include forms or toggles for configuring capture size, format preferences, and destination options.

2. **Storage API**:
   - Use `chrome.storage` or `browser.storage` APIs to persist user settings across sessions.
   - Handle retrieval and saving of settings from options page and popup UI.

#### 5. Integration with OneNote (or Custom Destination)

1. **API Integration**:
   - Utilize Microsoft Graph APIs or OneNote APIs for sending captures to the OneNote Windows app or cloud storage.
   - Implement authentication flow if necessary to access user's OneNote account.

2. **Destination Selection**:
   - Provide a dropdown or selection box in settings to choose between OneNote and other custom locations (local file system).

#### 6. Optional Mode Features

1. **Advanced Configuration**:
   - Implement a setup wizard or advanced settings page for users to train the extension with specific preferences (e.g., custom capture sizes, default formats).

2. **User Guidance**:
   - Provide tooltips or inline help within the extension UI to guide users through setting up and using advanced features.

### Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the extension thoroughly using Edge Developer Tools and other testing environments to ensure functionality across different scenarios (e.g., different webpages, formats, sizes).

2. **Deployment**:
   - Package the extension into a `.zip` file or use Edge's extension developer dashboard to publish it to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store.
   - Follow Edge's submission guidelines and review process for publishing extensions.

### Example Resources and Libraries

- **Microsoft Edge Extension API**: Official documentation and API references for developing Edge extensions.
- **html2canvas**: Library for capturing screenshots of webpages in HTML5 canvas.
- **pdfkit**: Library for generating PDF documents from HTML content.
